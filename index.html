                  <p>
                     Not only did Brandi‚Äôs work convince me to hire her as our wedding photographer, but her personality
                     and work ethic was icing on the cake. She was very communicative/responsive with me, even though, I
                     was planning a wedding 3,000 miles away and with a 3 hour difference. <br>
                     Our photos are gorgeous and dreamy! My husband was not a big fan of
                     being in front of the camera, and she made sure to make us feel comfortable and at ease. He loves
                     MANY
                     of the photos that Brandi took of us and that‚Äôs not an easy task. Thank you, Brandi! Can‚Äôt wait to
                     recommend you always!
                  </p>

                  <h4>CHANEL + BRETT</h4>
                  <p>
                     I cannot say enough good things about working with Brandi! We flew Brandi out to Hawaii for our
                     wedding, and despite being completely new to the island, she did an amazing job capturing our day!
                     She
                     went above and beyond to make sure she found the best locations to do our ‚Äúfirst look‚Äù and sunset
                     shots, and we were absolutely blown away by the final photos. Also from a very practical
                     standpoint,
                     she had our photos edited and sent to us in less than a month from our wedding day, which was the
                     cherry on top üôÇ
                  </p>

                  <h4>NICOLE + OODIE</h4>
                  <p>
                     Even though we knew the photos would be amazing, we didn‚Äôt think they could top the EXPERIENCE of
                     shooting with India. We both felt so ourselves and so celebrated. We were excited for the shoot, of
                     course, but never could have expected the experience or how meaningful these images are to us. <br>
                     We literally can‚Äôt thank her enough for the care and love she poured into these and into us. It is
                     so
                     special to feel so seen and warm and love our bodies in photos. Shooting with India was so special
                     for
                     us. Thank you....
