                  <h4>MONICA + CHANDLER</h4>
                  <p>
                     Not only did Emma’s work convince me to hire her as our wedding photographer, but her personality
                     and work ethic was icing on the cake. She was very communicative/responsive with me, even though, I
                     was planning a wedding 3,000 miles away and with a 3 hour difference. <br>
                     Our photos are gorgeous and dreamy! My husband was not a big fan of
                     being in front of the camera, and she made sure to make us feel comfortable and at ease. He loves
                     MANY
                     of the photos that Emma took of us and that’s not an easy task. Thank you, Emma! Can’t wait to
                     recommend you always!
                  </p>

                  <h4>RACHEL + ROSS</h4>
                  <p>
                     I cannot say enough good things about working with Emma! We flew Emma out to Hawaii for our
                     wedding, and despite being completely new to the island, she did an amazing job capturing our day!
                     She
                     went above and beyond to make sure she found the best locations to do our “first look” and sunset
                     shots, and we were absolutely blown away by the final photos. Also from a very practical
                     standpoint,
                     she had our photos edited and sent to us in less than a month from our wedding day, which was the
                     cherry on top.
                  </p>

                  <h4>JAMIE + DAVID</h4>
                  <p>
                     Even though we knew the photos would be amazing, we didn’t think they could top the EXPERIENCE of
                     shooting with Emma. We both felt so ourselves and so celebrated. We were excited for the shoot, of
                     course, but never could have expected the experience or how meaningful these images are to us. <br>
                     We literally can’t thank her enough for the care and love she poured into these and into us. It is
                     so
                     special to feel so seen and warm and love our bodies in photos. Shooting with Emma was so special
                     for
                     us. Thank you....
