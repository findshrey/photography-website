                     <p>
                        “Every now and then you come across individuals who were
                        simply born to do what they do. And when it comes to
                        Emma, no words could speak more truth. When looking back
                        through our wedding photos, we see a reflection of us as
                        people and the crazy love we share for each other. We
                        see a love story. Not only with each other, but the love
                        story we share with our beautiful friends and family.
                        What Emma does so well is capture those crazy, raw,
                        unguarded moments of pure love. The ones where no ones
                        looking, the flickers in between speeches and the
                        giggles across the table. These are the magic moments.
                        The moments you think back on that make your heart smile
                        as you think “god we had so much fun”. These are the
                        moments Emma brings to life through her photography.
                        Emma you are so much more than a photographer, you are a
                        storyteller. Thank you for helping us tell our love
                        story.”

                        know how incredibly over the moon we are with our final
                        photos. You captured the day so, so beautifully. I knew
                        the photographs would be lovely based on what I knew
                        about your work, but you seriously exceeded our
                        expectations in every way. You have such a gift – not
                        just as a photographer but with capturing the beauty in
                        people. Thank you for giving us these life long
                        memories.”

                     <p>
                        James and I knew we wanted to elope in Santorini. My
                        family heritage is Greek and we loved the adventure of
                        saying our vows on an island we’d never visited. &nbsp;I
                        found Emma’ work via The Lane, and immediately fell in
                        love. Her ability to capture the little, genuine moments
                        was so effortless and natural, which is exactly how I
                        wanted to remember our day. &nbsp;From our first meeting
                        at an incredible local restaurant a few days prior
                        (recommended by Emma), to a jaunt across the island to
                        find our locale the day before, Emma made every part of
                        our journey together memorable and fun.&nbsp;By the end
                        of our time together James and I truly felt like Emma
                        had not only become a friend, but extended family. James
                        and I got so much more than photos from Emma. &nbsp;She
                        was an integral part of why our elopement surpassed
                        James and I’s expectations.”

                     <p>
                        “I saw a photo from a wedding Emma shot in Santorini,
                        back in 2013 and I knew straight away there was no other
                        photographer that could capture our special day as
                        candidly and beautifully as Emma. Since then she has
                        been a part of all the special moments in our life,
                        including family sessions at home when our kids were
                        born. Emma is a pleasure to work with and has become a
                        true friend in the years we have known her. I treasure
                        every moment she has captured for us and can’t wait to
                        work with her again.”

                     <p>
                        Emma is a absolute gem and so much fun to work with! We
                        hired her for our engagement pictures and after working
                        with her and seeing how amazing she is at what she does,
                        we hired her for our wedding and I am so incredibly
                        happy that we did. Emma is professional, creative and
                        works so hard to capture your love story on camera. At
                        both our engagement shoot and on our wedding day Emma
                        arrived early to scope out good places to shoot and for
                        our wedding she brought along a second shooter who was
                        familiar with the venue. She makes you feel really
                        comfortable while shooting and the pictures she takes
                        are absolutely stunning, I cannot get over how talented
                        she is! Working with her was one of my favorite parts of
                        our engagement and wedding day!
