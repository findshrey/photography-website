               <p>
                  “Every now and then you come across individuals who were simply born to do what they do. And when
                  it
                  comes to Emma, no words could speak more truth. When looking back through our wedding photos, we
                  see a
                  reflection of us as people and the crazy love we share for each other. We see a love story. Not
                  only
                  with each other, but the love story we share with our beautiful friends and family. What Emma does
                  so
                  well is capture those crazy, raw, unguarded moments of pure love. The ones where no ones looking,
                  the
                  flickers in between speeches and the giggles across the table. These are the magic moments. The
                  moments you think back on that make your heart smile as you think “god we had so much fun”. These
                  are
                  the moments Emma brings to life through her photography. What is so special about Emma is her
                  innate
                  ability to tell the inimitable stories of people’s life and their love. Emma you are so much more
                  than
                  a photographer, you are a storyteller. Thank you for helping us tell our love story.”

                  “Hi Emma, I just wanted to write you an email to let you know how incredibly over the moon we
                  are
                  with our final photos. You captured the day so, so beautifully. I knew the photographs would be
                  lovely
                  based on what I knew about your work, but you seriously exceeded our expectations in every way. You
                  have such a gift – not just as a photographer but with capturing the beauty in people. Thank you
                  for
                  giving us these life long memories.”

               <h4>Jessica & Paul</h4>
               <p>
                  “Paul and I knew we wanted to elope in Santorini. My family heritage is Greek and we loved the
                  adventure of saying our vows on an island we’d never visited. &nbsp;I found Emma’ work via The
                  Lane,
                  and immediately fell in love. Her ability to capture the little, genuine moments was so effortless
                  and
                  natural, which is exactly how I wanted to remember our day. &nbsp;From our first meeting at an
                  incredible local restaurant a few days prior (recommended by Emma), to a jaunt across the island to
                  find our locale the day before, Emma made every part of our journey together memorable and
                  fun.&nbsp;By the end of our time together Paul and I truly felt like Emma had not only become a
                  friend, but extended family. &nbsp;When you elope, just the two of you, the people with you on your
                  day are so special, because they are a part of creating what was for us, the most memorable day of
                  our
                  lives. Paul and I got so much more than photos from Emma. &nbsp;She was an integral part of why our
                  elopement surpassed Paul and I’s expectations.”

               <p>
                  “I saw a photo from a wedding Emma shot in Santorini, back in 2013 and I knew straight away there
                  was
                  no other photographer that could capture our special day as candidly and beautifully as Emma. Since
                  then she has been a part of all the special moments in our life, including family sessions at home
                  when our kids were born. Emma is a pleasure to work with and has become a true friend in the years
                  we
                  have known her. I treasure every moment she has captured for us and can’t wait to work with her
                  again.”

                  support, guidance and of course your beautiful&nbsp;work that you captured. What amazing and
                  talented&nbsp;photographer&nbsp;you are and we are blessed to have had you be part of our wedding,

               <p>
                  Brandi is a absolute gem and so much fun to work with! We hired her for our engagement pictures and
                  after working with her and seeing how amazing she is at what she does, we hired her for our wedding
                  and I am so incredibly happy that we did. Brandi is professional, creative and works so hard to
                  capture your love story on camera. At both our engagement shoot and on our wedding day Brandi
                  arrived
                  early to scope out good places to shoot and for our wedding she brought along a second shooter who
                  was
                  familiar with the venue. She makes you feel really comfortable while shooting and the pictures she
                  takes are absolutely stunning, I cannot get over how talented she is! I would HIGHLY recommend
                  Brandi,
                  the engagement photos are gorgeous, we have only gotten the sneak peaks from the wedding and they
                  are
                  so dreamy and beautiful I cannot wait to get the rest. Working with her was one of my favorite
                  parts
                  of our engagement and wedding day!
